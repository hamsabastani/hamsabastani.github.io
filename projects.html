<p>1) LASSO project with Mohsen Bayati.

<p>I've done several simulations on real and fake datasets to study how feature correlations with the training label affect the performance of LASSO. However, I have mostly been using the popular glmnet package in R, which is sort of a black box. Currently, I'm trying to reproduce some of my results using a simpler and more transparent package called <a href = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/b1eb1016-1738-4bd5-83a9-370c9d498a03/>OWLQN</a>, as well as to formalize some of my results into conjectures. More on this to come (hopefully)...

<p>2) Detecting adverse events in healthcare with Andrea Montanari.

<p>I'm just getting started on this project with my new rotation advisor. Although he normally works on rather theoretical projects, Andrea graciously agreed to work on something more applied with me this quarter so that I can get a better flavor of different types of projects. The FDA now keeps an adverse events database where doctors can report adverse outcomes for patients taking certain drugs. Of course we can't jump to any conclusions about whether the drug actually caused said outcome since there are many, many biases in these reports -- the patient's pre-existing conditions, reporting bias, drug-drug interactions, etc. Several papers have looked at applying statistical methods to remove these biases and glean information of drug-adverse event associations as well as possible drug-drug interactions. We hope to approach the problem along the same vein, except with (hopefully) a more sophisticated statistical model.

<br>

<p>1) Zero-shot learning with Osbert Bastani, Milind Ganjoo, Richard Socher.

<p>I got started on this with Osbert for our CS 229 final project. You can read all about it in our (early) draft ICML paper <a href = http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3666>here</a>!
