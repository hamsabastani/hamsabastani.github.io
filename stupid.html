Stupid things that I do:
<p>
- Waited 15 minutes for a 10-second R simulation to complete. Nothing happened. Realized I forgot to press Enter.
<p>
- Halfway through a 4-hour MATLAB simulation. Tried to copy something from the MATLAB command window and pressed Ctrl-C. Unfortunately, this is the command for aborting the simulation as well.
